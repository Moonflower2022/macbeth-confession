                <p class="interview-text">LISA: Hi everyone! My name is Lisa Ogren, and this is the Minds of the Elite podcast,
                    where we delve into the minds of the rich and famous.</p>

                <p class="interview-text">LISA: To start off, how do you feel about your newly acquired kingly position?</p>

                <p class="interview-text">MACBETH: I am very happy to have all of this power to care for everyone. Being a
                    ruler of an entire country obviously won't be stress-free, but I think I will be able to withstand
                    it and make Scotland a better place. And I do definitely strive to fulfill the role of Duncan (god
                    bless him).</p>

                <p class="interview-text">LISA: Yeah, it sounds like a lot of work and responsibility. How did your wife take
                    the news?</p>

                <p class="interview-text">MACBETH: She was a little bit shocked at first, but we got through it together.</p>

                <p class="interview-text">LISA: Ah ok. On a different note, what are your thoughts on the accusations that
                    Duncan's guards were the murderers?</p>

                <p class="interview-text">MACBETH: Yeah, they were the murderers for sure. I think it's kind of sad that they
                    were so treacherous. I will make sure that does not happen to me.</p>

                <p class="interview-text">LISA: I agree. What do you think could have motivated them to murder the king?</p>

                <p class="interview-text">MACBETH: Maybe they wanted to become the kin-I mean, they were probably bribed to do
                    it.</p>

                <p class="interview-text">LISA: What was that you said? Something about becoming the king?</p>

                <p class="interview-text">MACBETH: No, just ignore what I said.</p>

                <p class="interview-text">LISA: Ok, moving on. What are somethings that you wa-</p>

                <p class="interview-text">MACBETH: It was me! I did it. I killed the king. I killed the king, and all this
                    time, I lied to everyone except for my wife, who helped me plan it. It's all my fault. Now I am the
                    king, and I have all of these duties I need to fulfill that I never wanted. I've been going insane
                    for the past week because of it.</p>

                <p class="interview-text">LISA: Wow. You know that I will publish this right? And you will at least go to
                    prison.</p>

                <p class="interview-text">MACBETH: Yeah, and I don't care. I don't care about anything anymore. I just needed
                    to get this off my chest.</p>
